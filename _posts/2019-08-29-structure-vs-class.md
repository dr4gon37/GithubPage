Hello everyone, <br/>
today post will be the shortest one so far. We will talk about differences between structure and class. <br/>
<!--more-->
This topic isn't hard but beginners programmers in C++ can have some thoughts about it. <br/>

It's a common, good convention to use structure only for data without any methods, constructors or destructor. Just only data. This is the first difference. <br/>
Of coure structure have methods and even constructor or destructor. Structures are avalaible in C++ to keep backward compatibility with C. <br/>

The second difference is that members of a class are private by default, in structure there are public. <br/>

The third difference. The default visibility of structure is public, the class is private. It means also, if you donâ€™t specify anything then the struct will inherit publicly from its base class: <br/>
{% highlight c++ %}
struct T : Base // struct T : public Base
{
   ...
};

class T : Base // class T : private Base
{
   ...
};

{% endhighlight %}

There are no mow differences between structure and class in C++.  <br/>
To prove it, we will look at that code:  <br/>
{% highlight c++ %}
#include <type_traits>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    struct Str {};
    
    std::cout << std::is_class<Str>::value; //1 
}
{% endhighlight %}
