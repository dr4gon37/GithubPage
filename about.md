Hello!
Welcome to my blog. I am 3rd year student of TUL (Lodz University of Technology) on field FTIMS (Technical Physics, Information Technology and Applied Mathematics) on specialization: Computer Simulation and Games Technology
<br>
On my website I will share you with my knowledge of C++, which I have been gaining during my studies.
<br>
I hope the lore, which you are able to find here, help you with any trouble you will get.
in the foreseeable future there is a possibility that the page will growns on modern OpenGL Api and Java. 


You can find my other project in the link:
